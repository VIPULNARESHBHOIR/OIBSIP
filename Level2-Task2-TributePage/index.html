              Bhimrao Ambedkar is termed as the father of the Constitution of India.
              Though he hailed from a socially backward caste, he rose to
              unparalleled height. As a result of casteism, he was subjected to
              blatant discrimination at school. However, it did not hold him back
              from attaining excellent marks and pursuing higher education. He was
              determined to bring about a radical change in society.Babasaheb
              Ambedkar’s full name was Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. He took birth on 14th
              April 1891. He was born to Ramji Maloji Sakpal and Bhimabai in a small
              village in Madhya Pradesh. As a child, he took a deep interest in
              studies. He became the first law minister after India became
              independent. He fought for the backward class as he could not see
              unjust against Untouchables or Dalits. He wrote the Indian
              Constitution in India’s national language – Hindi. He was awarded the
              Bharat Ratna in 1990. He died of Diabetes on 6th December 1956. Many
              statues and parks are built in his memory.When Bhimrao Ambedkar was born to a poor Dalit father Ramji Maloji Sakpal and mother Bhimabai in a small Mhow village of Madhya Pradesh, nobody knew that he would grow up to be a great leader.  Every year, his birth date, 14th April 1891, is celebrated as Ambedkar Jayanti in India.  Though he hailed from a socially backward class and faced discrimination at every stage of his life, it never stopped him from becoming one of the greatest scholars of all time.  Moreover, his childhood was a series of struggles to fight prejudice for being Untouchables or Dalits.  His teachers and the other upper caste students would not allow Ambedkar to sit near them.  He was not allowed to touch the earthen pot to drink water.  Yet, he was not discouraged and continued to excel in academics.  After attaining his degree from the Elphinstone College, Bombay, he obtained his postgraduate degree from the London School of Economics.  He further continued his doctorate in political science and economics from the University of Columbia, USA.He was a social activist, economist, reformer, and politician.  He held the post of the first law minister of our Independent India.  He was recognized as one of the greatest scholars and was invited to lead the committee to draft the Indian constitution.  He wanted to bring about dynamic social reforms in India.  He lent his voice to the suppressed and backward community.  He was determined to eradicate the caste system, promote education, and uplift the Untouchables.  He was the founder of the Independent Labour Party and the Scheduled Caste Federation.  He also contributed to the  Finance Commission of India and Reserve Bank of India.  In 1956, he became a Buddhist follower.  6th December is mourned as his death anniversary.  In 1990, he was conferred with Bharat Ratna for his contribution to India. more..
